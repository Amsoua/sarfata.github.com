      <h3>An arduino wifi lamp</h3>
      <p>I had this crazy idea a while ago that there is a better way to do lamps than what is being done by Ikea & co today.</p>
      <p>We all hate having to go around the house at night to turn all the lights off; and similarly, having to run around in the dark to turn the lights on. I looked around for "smart-lamps" and found a few things, but none matched my idea so I decided to design one and see how much it would cost. Of course, the challenge with lamps is that you have a few around your house and probably would like to not add an extra $100 to each of them.</p>
